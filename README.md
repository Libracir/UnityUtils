A collection of scripts I use in my unity projects

## Current Utilitys

### 2D Dynamic/Static Sorting Order
Changes the Sorting Order of Gameobjects during runtime or on start to make things further up render behind and things further down render in front.

### Basic 2D Camera
A very basic 2D camera, has two bounds, x and y, and when passed the camera will follow the targeted gameObject.

### Collidable
A class to be inherited from, gives the ability to run a function on collision, with an unlimited number of collisions overlapping.

### Face Mouse 2D
Makes the GameObject it's attached to always follow the mouse.

### Screen Shake
Contains a function to trigger a screen shake effect, Duration and Strength of the shake can both be set through this function.

### Lerp To Point
Moves a GameObject to a given point, if the distance changes, you can either lock the amount of time it takes or the speed which it travels at
